    text: "I recently got my Australian student visa on 24th September for Diploma of IT + Bachelor of IT at CDU, and I am so grateful to Mentiors Study Abroad for making this journey smooth and successful. I had completed my HSC in 2023, and from the very beginning, they guided me step by step with care and professionalism.I especially want to mention Nabila Apu from the Banani branch, who was my counselor. She was incredibly supportive, patient, and always available whenever I had questions or confusion. Her guidance gave me confidence throughout the process, from admission to visa approval. I truly appreciate the effort and dedication of the whole team. I highly recommend Mentiors Study Abroad, especially Nabila Apu, to anyone planning to study abroad!",

    text: "I am delighted and humbled to have the opportunity to fly to Perth, Australia, on July 12th.I was admitted to the University of Western Australia. My visa was granted on 27th June 2024, with in two weeks of visa application. I was devastated when I was denied a visa for Canada since I applied via a different agency, my documents were tampered with, and I was not informed of this. Fortunately, I visited Mentors' Study Abroad Uttara Branch Campus II and met with Jawad Hossain Bhaiya, the branch's counsellor. He took the responsibility as his own and encouraged me throughout the process. I am satisfied with his counselling. I will remain eternally grateful to Mentors' for making every attempt to make my dream come true.",
